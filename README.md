## What it does

- Starts counting down work minutes once you start the timer
- User can change the set work minutes/break minutes and whether if they want the switch between work and break mode to be automatic 
- add/delete tasks
- keep track of tasks that are completed so user can see how many tasks they have completed in each task

## Why I built it

I wanted a hands-on project to practice **react fundamentals**:  
- using react hooks such as useEffect for countdown,  
- context api to keep track of each session
- creating custom hooks
- experiment with custom components
